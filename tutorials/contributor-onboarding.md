status: first outline (draft, WIP)

Discussion is [here](https://github.com/hoodiehq/documentation/issues/65), looking forward to reading your comments and input! <3

## About this document

 > "Being a committer does not mean you commit code, it means you are committed to the project."*  
 > â€“ [Apache Software Foundation](https://community.apache.org/contributors/)

In this document you will learn about our onboarding process for new people who want to join us in the work on Hoodie.

According to our [Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct.html), we are aiming to provide a safe space for everyone in this community. And we're happy to welcome everyone, including developers and people who want to become one of our non-coding contributors. 

This document is and will always be work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve our onboarding and community culture and always happy to get feedback!

###  Where can people contribute?

Hoodie is a quite big project and we have various parts that need to be created and / or maintained. To find out where we need help, take a look at our [Contribute Site](#).

---------------

### 1. After getting in touch

Try to speak to the new contributors in person at least once as you will be their contact for the first weeks. We learned that this clears a lot of obstacles in communication and helps getting things going faster. Also, meeting new people is always fun!

The easiest way to do this is a quick Skype call or Google Hangout with the person interested and at least one exsisitng contributer (this could be you already). If you happen to be in the same town, meeting for lunch/coffee/walking is always the preferrable option.

### 2. Getting Started together

As the first and frontmost contact for the new contributors, you are responsible for making them a part of team.

1. Introduce them to our Code of Conduct. Not just mention it but make them at least briefly read it and ask whether they have questions or concerns.
2. Find out what their status quo is:
  - what skills do they have?
     - are they coders?
        - frontend/backend/mobile?
     - are they non-coders?
        - communications/orga/project management?
  - what are their interests in Hoodie? What do they want to work on?
  - what are their interests regarding personal skills what are they learning?
3. Depending on how far their knowledge is, introduce them to Hoodie related terms and processes (see [The Hoodie Glossary](Hoodie terms https://github.com/hoodiehq/documentation/blob/gh-pages/glossary.md) and [FAQ](http://faq.hood.ie/)for more information).



### 3. Introducing the surroundings

Hoodie has various communication channels and workflows that can be quite confusing for people who are new in the community. At this phase, your job is to make sure that they know how to effectively communicate with the rest of the team and make sure they are always in the loop.

#### The IRC channel
- how to access
- what to post
- how to ask
- office hours

#### GitHub
- repository strucutre
- how to get access
- how to write good commit messages
- how to file issues
- how/why to submit pull requests

#### Technical things
- how to read the [documentation](https://github.com/hoodiehq/documentation)
- for developers
   - code review process
   - release process
   - testing process
   - conventions
- for non-coding contributors
   - content review process

#### Our Tools
Hoodie has a few tools and workflow that we created or agreed to use. Your job is to show the new contributors a quick overview of those tools and show how they can use or access them.

- Milestones http://gr2m.github.io/milestones/
- show Hoodie Showcases http://faq.hood.ie/#/question/38208773 and http://faq.hood.ie/#/question/38208813

#### Accounts

In order to get started for real, the new controbutors of course need access to our software and repositories. Please make sure you only create accounts for the things these contributors need access to, in order to get their work done.

 - GitHub
 - Wordpress

### 4. Finding a Workflow

Finally! Your contributors are all set and ready to get started. You now have to work out a frequent feedback loop that fits both your and your contributor's schedule.

- mentoring (who does it? + introduction)
- pairings (with whom, how often and when?)

### 5. Introducing to the team

Your contributors are now a part of the big Hoodie Family!
Please introduce them to the other team members be sending a quick welcome email and maybe writing a blog post. Of course not only the team wants to know more about the contributors but the contributors also want to get to know the team! Maybe you can help arranging short one-on-ones with other team members.

You should also add them the the [team section](#) of our website and post a tweet about their addition the the team.

### 6. Staying in touch

The most diffucult job of onboarding is making sure the contributors are always motivated and never left alone if they are having difficulties or problems. You can stay in touch by offering continuous mentoring and painr (for example once every two weeks, depending on the amount of work they want to contribute) and frequent quick chats or emails.

### 7. Improve

After a few weeks you should ask the new Hoodie for feedback on our onboarding process and share your insight with everyone else.
