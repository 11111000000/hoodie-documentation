## About this document

*"Being a committer does not mean you commit code, it means you are committed to the project."*  
([Apache Software Foundation](https://community.apache.org/contributors/))

This doc aims to document our onboarding process for new people who want to join us in the work on Hoodie. According to our [Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct.html), we're aiming to provide a safe space for everyone in this community. And we're happy to welcome both developers and people who want to become one of our non-coding contributors. 

This doc itself is and will always be work in progress. We're aiming to get feedback on how we're doing with our onboarding and community culture, and implement this feedback into this doc.
